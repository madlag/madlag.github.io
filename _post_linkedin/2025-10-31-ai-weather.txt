AI Weather Today: Cloudy with Risks of API Outages

As I started my day, I was a bit disappointed when I saw that Claude was not working, and so was the Anthropic API. 
I would have to wait a few hours to get back to code with my favorite agent in Cursor, claude-4.5-sonnet.

But here's what surprised me:

Cursor was humming along just fine with the Anthropic API in the background ingesting my refactor requests and all the usual stuff.

What does this tell us? It's quite obvious Anthropic is focusing on code models, just like OpenAI is focusing on the consumer facing ChatGPT (even if Claude chatbot is very good). The way Claude Sonnet 4.5 is up in Cursor when it is down everywhere else is just a clear sign.

If you want to follow me down this rabbit hole, you can read my full post here:

This is hopefully the first post in a series about the AI landscape: practical advice about how to use code agents, and the AI battleground - bottlenecks, trends, battles, and who's going to win. I have no idea where it will lead us, but that's part of the fun!
